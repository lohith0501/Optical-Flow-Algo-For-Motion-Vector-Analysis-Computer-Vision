# Optical-Flow-Algo-For-Motion-Vector-Analysis-Computer-Vision
Motion vectors are the key features which will help to fetch magnitude and direction of the images that vary frame by frame. Optical flow is one of the algorithm which performs better for such tasks. It uses Brigtness constancy assumption and taylor series to achieve.
